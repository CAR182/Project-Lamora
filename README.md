# Project Lamora

This project was an experiment to better understand ThreeJS and play around with the Slack API.
It's fairly basic in that it runs a simple websocket server that is polling the SlackAPI and waiting for messages. Those messages
are the transformed into 3D HTML and animated on the central hub. It was a fun intro to 3D web design!
